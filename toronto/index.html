							Toronto is Canada’s largest city and is North America’s fifth most populous municipality – with a population of 2.7 million people.

							The Greater Toronto Area, usually called the GTA is home to 6 million people.
							
							Canada’s government expects the GTA’s population will reach 7.7 million by 2025.

							Known as one of the world’s most multi-cultural cities, Toronto prides itself on its wide range of cultures, languages, food and arts. Almost half of its population are immigrants.

								Toronto has a semi-continental climate, with a warm, humid summer and a cold winter.<br/>
								Toronto’s climate is modified by its location on the shores of Lake Ontario. The water in the lake ensures Toronto is warmer in winter and cooler in summer than it would otherwise be. The Great Lakes location is also the source of Toronto’s summer humidity, which many people find uncomfortable. <br/>
								Although Toronto is one of Canada’s warmer cities in winter, winters are still severe, with snow on the ground most days between mid-December and mid-March. Snow deeper than 1 cm is seen on 65 days a year on average.
								Ottawa, which is farther north than Toronto, and does not sit lakeside, has snow depths of greater than 1 cm on about 120 days each year.
								Many factories and industrial plants in both Canada and the USA are located on the Great Lakes and smog has become something of a problem in Southern Ontario. About half of the smog is wind-borne from the USA.

						According to Forbes, powerful cities such as Toronto attract investment due to the size of their economy, their projected future prosperity, cost of living and quality of life. Forbes describes Toronto as lying at the economic heart of one of the world’s wealthiest countries, projected to keep humming through 2020. <br/>

						The other top ten most economically powerful cities identified by Forbes were London, Hong Kong, New York, Tokyo, Chicago, Seoul, Paris, Los Angeles, and Shanghai.<br/>

						Toronto has North America’s third largest concentration of private IT companies, bettered only by San Francisco and New York. <br/>
						
						In addition to IT and high finance Ontario’s plentiful natural resources, such as hydroelectricity and raw materials, have helped Toronto and its surrounding municipalities to become major industrial centres, producing more than 50 percent of Canada’s manufactured products.<br/>
						
						From the perspective of today’s more troubled economic times, Canada’s banks never extended themselves as unwisely as some of their American and European counterparts and have relatively strong balance sheets.<br/>
						
						Toronto currently has a construction boom dominated by condo developments and office buildings. Both the Conference Board of Canada and Oxford Economics predict that Toronto’s economy will grow healthily in 2015 and 2016, by about 3% annually.<br/>
						
						Figures published by Statistics Canada show that over 150,000 net full-time jobs were created in the Toronto region in the 12 months to August 2015. As a result of these new jobs, the unemployment rate in the Toronto region is 7.5% at the end of August 2015.
